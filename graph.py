# In matplotlib there are two ways to create plots: using procedural methods and using object-oriented approach.
# To allow more customization, we need to move to a more object-based way to make the plots. This method involves
# storing various elements of the of the plots in variables (these are objects in object-oriented terminology).
# Creating a new figure
fig = plt.figure()

# The second line creates subplot on a 1x1 grid. As we described before, the arguments for add_subplot are the number of
# rows,columns, and the ID of the subplot, between 1 and the number of columns times the number of rows.
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)  # create an axes object in the figure
# NOTE: Weâ€™re going to create a subplot to make it easier for us to draw on the same plot over and over again.
